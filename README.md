BGG MCP provides access to the BoardGameGeek API through the [Model Context Protocol](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol), enabling retrieval and filtering of board game data, user collections, and profiles. The server is implemented in Go, using the [GoGeek](https://github.com/kkjdaniel/gogeek) library, which helps ensure robust API interactions.

Price data is provided by [BoardGamePrices.co.uk](https://boardgameprices.co.uk), offering real-time pricing from multiple retailers.

Game recommendations are powered by [Recommend.Games](https://recommend.games/), which provides algorithmic similarity recommendations based on BoardGameGeek data.

## Installation

You have multiple options for installing BGG MCP:

### A) Installing via Smithery (Recommended)

Get started in under a minute with [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@kkjdaniel/bgg-mcp):

1. **Sign up** at Smithery and select your client (e.g., Claude Desktop)
2. **Follow the quick setup** - Smithery handles all configuration automatically
3. **Start using BGG tools** immediately - no manual setup required

#### For Claude Desktop Users

Add BGG MCP as a custom connector:

1. Go to **Settings ‚Üí Connectors ‚Üí Add custom connector**
2. Enter this URL:
   ```
   https://server.smithery.ai/@kkjdaniel/bgg-mcp/mcp
   ```
3. Click **Connect** to authorise

That's it! The server uses the latest Streamable HTTP transport.

### B) MCP Registry

Install via the MCP Registry:

```bash
mcp install io.github.kkjdaniel/bgg-mcp
```

### C) Manual Setup

#### 1. Install Go

You will need to have Go installed on your system to build binary. This can be easily [downloaded and setup here](https://go.dev/doc/install), or you can use the package manager that you prefer such as Brew.

#### 2. Build

The project includes a Makefile to simplify building and managing the binary.

```bash
# Build the application (output goes to build/bgg-mcp)
make build

# Clean build artifacts
make clean

# Both clean and build
make all
```

Or you can simply build it directly with Go...

```bash
go build -o build/bgg-mcp
```

#### 3. Add MCP Config

In the `settings.json` (VS Code / Cursor) or `claude_desktop_config.json` add the following to your list of servers, pointing it to the binary you created earlier, once you load up your AI tool you should see the tools provided by the server connected:

```json
"bgg": {
    "command": "path/to/build/bgg-mcp",
    "args": ["-mode", "stdio"]
}
```

More details for configuring Claude can be [found here](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user).

## Optional Configuration

### Username Configuration (Optional)

You can optionally set the `BGG_USERNAME` environment variable to enable "me" and "my" references in queries:

```json
"bgg": {
    ...
    "env": {
        "BGG_USERNAME": "your_bgg_username"
    }
}
```

This enables:

- **Collection queries**: "Show my collection" instead of specifying your username
- **User queries**: "Show my BGG profile"
- **AI assistance**: The AI can automatically use your username for comparisons and analysis

**Note**: When you use self-references (me, my, I) without setting BGG_USERNAME, you'll get a clear error message.
